GDP Forecasting: ARIMA Model
I have worked on Time Forecasting ARIMA Modeling on R Studio to Predict the GDP of India for the next 10 Years. I have done Data Cleaning, Data Preparing, ACF & PACF Plotting, and ran Dickey-Fuller tests. Then built a Model through ARIMA Modeling, Validated the Model, and then Forecasted it for the next 10 years.
